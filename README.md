### Project Description

Project Canopy's mission is to de-fragment and de-silo data relevant to the Congo Basin rainforest, and provide the analytical tools with which to interpret that data. By making knowledge accessible to donors, governments, and the public at large, we can help policy- and decision-makers concerned with the Congo Basin to craft better laws and programs to address deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate change.

### Key Features

- Create an intuitive combination of datasets from which decisionmakers and organizations can draw conclusions based on well-formed questions
- Provide users with interactive visualizations to answer questions, discover trends and make predictions around threats to biodiversity and deforestation
- Create an automated workflow to provide local law enforcement agencies with updated "species ID cards", to be used in their work of regulated trade in timber and wildlife.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

- Supports reusable components
- Ease of deployment and maintenance

#### Redux

- Integrates well with Redux
- State management capabilities match that of application

#### Chart.js

- Data visualization

#### Fuse.js

- An easy to use and customizable fuzzy search library

#### Ant Design

- Enterprise-class UI designed for web applications
- A set of high-quality React components out of the box
- Whole package of design resources and development tools

#### Styled Components

- Automatic critical CSS
- No class name bugs
- Simple dynamic styling

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify(https://master.d2m0cg5et4t40w.amplifyapp.com/)

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/project-canopy-be) built using:

#### Node.js

- is designed to build scalable network applications
- ease of use

#### Express.js

- is a minimal and flexible framework
- provides a robust set of features for web applications

# APIs

## [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)

The IUCN Red List shows us where and what actions need to be taken to save the building blocks of nature from extinction. It provides a straightforward way to factor biodiversity needs into decision-making processes by providing a wealth of useful information on species.

## [CITES](https://www.cites.org/)

CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_BACKENDURL - links to the backend server

# Testing

### Jest

- aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects
- Tests are parallelized by running them in their own processes to maximize performance

# Installation Instructions

- Fork and Clone Repository
- CD into project-canopy-fe
- run NPM install to download dependencies

## Other Scripts

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
